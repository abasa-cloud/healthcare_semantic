Project Overview

This project aims to analyze churn rates among patients in healthcare clinics. By leveraging data from patients, clinics, doctors, and appointments, we seek to identify patterns and factors contributing to patient churn. The analysis provides actionable insights for clinics to improve patient retention and overall service quality.
Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following data sources:
Patients: Demographic and personal information of patients.
Clinics: Details about the clinics including location, services offered, and other attributes.
Doctors: Information about doctors including specialties, experience, and association with clinics.
Appointments: Records of patient appointments, including dates, times, and outcomes.
Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:
dbt (Data Build Tool): For data transformation and modeling.
Snowflake: As the data warehousing solution.
Python: For data analysis, visualization, and additional processing.
Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-analysis.git
cd churn-analysis
Set up Python environment:
sh
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure dbt:
Follow the instructions on dbt documentation to set up your profile.
Ensure your profile is configured to connect to Snowflake.
Data Pipeline

The data pipeline consists of several steps to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data into Snowflake and transform it using dbt:
Extract: Raw data is extracted from source systems and loaded into Snowflake.
Transform: Using dbt, data is transformed to create meaningful models that can be analyzed.
Load: The transformed data is loaded back into Snowflake, ready for analysis.
Analysis Process

The analysis process involves several key steps:
Data Cleaning: Cleaning and preprocessing raw data to ensure quality and consistency.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that help in understanding churn patterns.
Modeling: Building predictive models to identify factors influencing patient churn.
Visualization: Creating visualizations to communicate findings and insights.
Results

The analysis reveals several key insights into patient churn, including:
High churn rates among certain demographics.
The impact of clinic location and services on patient retention.
Doctor-patient interactions and their influence on churn.
Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the results directory.
Future Work

Potential areas for future work include:
Incorporating additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
Refining predictive models to improve accuracy.
Implementing real-time churn prediction and alert systems.
